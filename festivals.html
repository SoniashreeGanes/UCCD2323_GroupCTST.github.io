                                            <h4>Hari Raya Aidilfitri</h4>
                                            <p>
                                                In Malaysia, the Islamic New Year festival of Eid al-Fitr,
                                                also known as Hari Raya Aidil Fitri, holds great significance.
                                                As more than half of the country's population consists of ethnic Malays
                                                who
                                                follow Islam, this festival is widely celebrated.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                Hari Raya marks the conclusion of the ninth month of the Islamic
                                                calendar,
                                                known as Ramadhan, which involves fasting from dawn to sunset.
                                                In Malaysia, it is observed as a two-day nationwide holiday,
                                                during which many families return to their hometowns to celebrate with
                                                their extended families.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                Some Muslim families practice the tradition of hosting an
                                                'open house' called 'rumah buka,' where they invite neighbors and
                                                community members to their homes to join in the festivities.
                                                Guests are treated to a variety of delicious food, including
                                                curry chicken, beef rendang, chicken satay, ketupat, lemang,
                                                rose syrup, cakes, cookies, and tarts.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                Throughout the Eid celebrations, major cities like Kuala Lumpur,
                                                Singapore, and Jakarta are adorned with stunning and brightly
                                                illuminated decorations, creating a festive atmosphere on the
                                                streets, especially at night.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>

                                            </p>
                                            Chinese New Year is the only festival in Malaysia that receives a two-day
                                            nationwide holiday,
                                            besides Hari Raya. During this time, the country is adorned in red
                                            decorations as Chinese
                                            families and businesses follow the ancient Chinese tradition of warding off
                                            evil spirits.
                                            <p>

                                            </p>
                                            Although Chinese New Year traditionally lasts for 15 days, most Chinese
                                            families spend the
                                            first two days together before resuming their regular routines. However,
                                            many Chinese
                                            communities continue their celebratory traditions throughout the festive
                                            season,
                                            including lion dance performances, fireworks, and house visitations.

                                                The Indian festival of Diwali, known as Deepavali in Malaysia where it
                                                is celebrated
                                                as a national holiday, is a vibrant and colorful celebration like no
                                                other.
                                                Referred to as the Festival of Lights, Deepavali holds profound
                                                significance
                                                as it represents the triumph of light and hope over darkness.

                                            <p>
                                                The festivities commence with a ritualistic oil bath and prayer at the
                                                break of dawn.
                                                As the day unfolds, the streets come alive with a myriad of activities,

                                                processions, street fairs, and mesmerizing fireworks displays. However,
                                                what truly
                                                encapsulates the spirit of Deepavali is the tantalizing aroma of a
                                                diverse array of
                                                dishes wafting through the air, especially in areas with a significant

                                                    Wesak is a profound Buddhist festival celebrated to honor the birth,

                                                    Lord Buddha. The festivities commence at the break of dawn, with
                                                    devout Buddhists congregating at temples to engage in prayer,
                                                    meditation, and the noble act of offering food and charity to those
                                                    in need. This significant national holiday culminates in a
                                                    spectacular float procession that is a sight to behold. The
                                                    procession typically features a majestic and towering statue of
                                                    Buddha, adding to the grandeur of this sacred celebration.
